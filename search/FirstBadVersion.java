/**
 * You are currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately,
 * the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
 * Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions
 * after a bad version are also bad.
 *
 * Suppose you have n versions (1, 2, ..., n) and you want to find out the first
 * bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 *
 * You are given an API tool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether
 * version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version.
 * You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
 *
 * E.g.
 * 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 * G G G B B B B B B B
 * L       M         H
 * L   M   H
 *       L H
